             The forty bravehearts who rode their Royal Enfields to Khardung-la for the first time in 1997, set off a culture of explorations. Since then, Royal Enfield motorcycles have been allies to many such epic trips. This active pursuit to ride to new places, in a simple and unhurried manner, 
             is what makes for Royal Enfieldâ€™s purpose of delivering pure motorcycling experience.
